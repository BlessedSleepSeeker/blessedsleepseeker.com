## Concept

A unique website used for storing and presenting my works, as well as posting update and allowing peoples to follow what I do.
Essentially a fusion between github and twitter.
End goal is to be able to move away from both twitter and github (or at least to stop uploading files on their server and keep in-house)

- Unique "project" page : analog to <https://gallery.rmzc.xyz/> but each projects has it's own page
  - The goal is to make the projects look really good :)
- Project might have a "sources" page with source files available openly
  - The source either a git repository or straight up files.
- Blog system + RSS Feed.

## Technology

Backend : Django
Front-end : Django Template + Bootstrap

## Remaining Work

- Individual Project Pages for /dev and diy/
- French translation
- Listing of all the work I will put up
- Deployment
